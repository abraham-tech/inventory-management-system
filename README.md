# Inventory Management System for Small Businesses

ABC Inc. is a small business that needs an efficient solution to manage their inventory. Their current system, a mix of spreadsheets and manual tracking, is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks features to optimize stock levels and ordering. This inefficiency results in stockouts, slow order delivery, excess inventory, and lost sales.
