### Problem Statement: Inventory Management System for Small Businesses
ABC Inc. is a small business struggling to manage their inventory efficiently. Their current system, a mix of spreadsheets and manual tracking, is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks features to optimize stock levels and ordering. This inefficiency leads to stockouts, slow order delivery, excess inventory, and lost sales.

ABC Inc. requires a web-based inventory management system to:
Track Products: Create and maintain a database of products with details like ID, name, description, price, and current stock level.
Manage Suppliers: Store information about suppliers, including the products they supply. Allow adding, removing, and editing supplier details.
Process Orders: Enable customers to place orders containing multiple products. The system should calculate the total order cost based on product prices and quantities.
Maintain Stock Levels: Provide functionalities to add or remove products from inventory, update stock levels based on sales and purchases, and generate low-stock alerts to prevent stockouts.
Customer Management: Store customer information and allow them to view their order history and potentially cancel orders (depending on specific business needs).
Store customer information, including name, contact details, order history, and payment status.
Allow customers to view their order history and current order status.
Enable customers to request order cancellations or modifications online.
Track customer feedback and satisfaction levels.
Implement a loyalty program to reward frequent customers.

Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports on inventory levels, sales trends, and supplier performance to inform better stock management and purchasing decisions.
Analyze sales trends to identify best-selling products, seasonal demand, and revenue forecasts.
Evaluate supplier performance based on delivery times, order accuracy, and product quality.
Generate customer reports to understand purchasing patterns and customer demographics.
Offer customizable report templates and export options (e.g., PDF, Excel).

Billing and Invoicing (Handle Financial Transactions):
Generate invoices for completed orders, including detailed billing information.
Allow customers to view and pay their invoices online via various payment methods.
Track outstanding payments and send automated reminders to customers.
Integrate with accounting software to streamline financial management.

The system should be accessible through a web browser.
